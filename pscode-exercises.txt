// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

array = int, int, int, int, int
avg = (int + int + int + int + int) / legth(array)

smallest = array(a)	#first value in array
for a from 1 to length(array)
	element_a = array(a)
	if minimum > element_a
		minimum = alement_a

for b from 1 to length(array)
	element_b = array(b)
	if maximum < element_b
		maximum = element_b

display "The average is (avg). The lowest number is (minimum). The highest number is (maxmimum)."
